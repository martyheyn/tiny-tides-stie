Tummy time is an essential part of your baby’s development. It helps to strengthen your baby’s neck, back, and shoulder muscles
and promotes motor skills. Our groups are designed to provide a fun and engaging environment for your little one to explore and
grow. For babies from birth to pre-crawling, come join a tummy time group for a supportive environment for babies and caregivers
to learn the basics of tummy time while connecting and socializing with other families.
