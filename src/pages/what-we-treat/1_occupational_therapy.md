Wondering what pediatric occupational therapy (OT) is and how it helps babies? Occupational therapy for infants focuses on supporting babies in developing essential skills they need for growth, comfort, and exploration. From building motor skills, easing feeding challenges, to supporting sensory processing and regulation, OT helps babies reach key milestones at their own pace. With gentle, guided activities, Dr. Erin works to boost strength, coordination, regulation, and overall development so babies can make big waves!
