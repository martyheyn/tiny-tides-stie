<span class=" font-semibold bg-blue-600/10">Do mealtimes feel like a constant negotiation or a source of stress for your family?</span> Maybe your child sticks to a handful of foods, refuses new textures, or struggles to sit at the table. Our service focuses on transforming these mealtime challenges into opportunities for growth.

Using a responsive, child-led approach, we explore sensory and behavioral barriers to eating, introducing gentle strategies to expand your childâ€™s palate. These sessions are designed to make mealtimes more relaxed and enjoyable while ensuring your child builds a healthy relationship with food. The result? A happier, more adventurous eater and a calmer dining experience for the whole family!
