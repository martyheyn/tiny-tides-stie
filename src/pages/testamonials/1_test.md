<p class="text-base">
I reached out to Erin for a breastfeeding assessment for me and my 2 month old and she couldn’t have been more helpful. She did a body assessment of my little one and showed me exercises to do with her to help relieve tension and improve feeding. She was extremely helpful and supportive and I’ve already seen small improvements in feeding just a few days later.
