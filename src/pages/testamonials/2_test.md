<p class="text-base">
Erin is a phenomenal therapist. She is holistic, parent/child centered and inclusive. As a baby therapist myself, I have a high bar when it comes to other therapists. There is nobody else I would recommend if your child is having feeding difficulties or just wanted some support on your babyâ€™s solids journey. She is communicative and caring with the best interest of the child in mind. Erin goes above and beyond each time and there is nobody I would trust more!
