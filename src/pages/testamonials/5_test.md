Erin is AMAZING! Our son has hypotonia and struggles with sensory and oral motor function issues. Feeding is such a specialized area, and Erin is an expert and very knowledgeable. She worked with our son for nearly a year and our son loved his sessions with her. We were so fortunate to have found Erin and highly recommend her to anyone looking for an occupational therapist.
