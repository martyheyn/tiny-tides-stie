            <p>
              Hi, I’m Erin, the founder of Tiny Tides Therapy. I hold a
              Doctorate in Occupational Therapy and am a Certified Lactation
              Counselor. My passion is providing holistic, functional therapy
              that meets families where they are, targeting specific goals to
              support each unique journey.
            </p>

            <p>
              At Tiny Tides, we understand that a child’s development, much like
              the ocean, comes in many waves. From feeding and meeting
              milestones to managing sensory needs, every stage of growth brings
              its own set of challenges and triumphs. I specialize in supporting
              infants through these waves of development, offering guidance in
              areas such as tummy time, breast and bottle feeding, transitioning
              to solids, oral motor dysfunction, and tongue and lip ties. I also
              work with families on sensory processing, regulation, body
              tension, and infant massage to nurture the whole child.
            </p>

            <p>
              Tiny Tides Therapy is dedicated to guiding families through all
              the waves of development, while ensuring a compassionate and
              individualized plan that fosters confidence and success. It’s my
              mission to empower families while creating a sense of community
              where families can thrive together.
